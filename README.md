In this classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, typically "X" and "O," aiming to form a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this goal wins the game, while a full board with no winner results in a draw. It's a straightforward yet engaging game that tests players' strategic thinking and foresight.
